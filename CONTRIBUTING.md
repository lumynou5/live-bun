# Contributing

Thank you for having interest in contributing.  Here is a guideline.

## Branches

This project uses Git flow, so there are two permanent branches: `main` and
`develop`.  `main` refers to the latest stable release, while `develop` is
developing and unstable.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Clone your fork to local.
- Create a branch based on `develop`.
- Now you can make your changes.  Remember to write meaningful commit messages.
  Check [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) to see how.
- Open a pull request on GitHub.  If you haven't complete, please mark the PR
  a draft.

Some general conventions include:

- A pull request covers only one thing, like a new feature or a bug fix.
- A commit changes only one thing.  If you find that you can't describe the
  change in a short sentence and/or it's two sentences connected with "and",
  you should seperate the change into two commits.
